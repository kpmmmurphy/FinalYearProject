FinalYearProject
================

This Repo contains the Sensor Management System and the RESTful API developed for my 
final year project. These were developed while studying at the University College of Cork. Additionally the project includes an Android Application as the user interface, and a Peripheral Sensing System.

Here is a high level overall architecture of the project.
